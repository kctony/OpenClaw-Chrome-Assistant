    <p>The <strong>OpenClaw Chrome Assistant</strong> extension is designed with privacy as a core principle. This policy explains how we handle data.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>This extension <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit</strong> any personal data to servers owned or operated by the developers. All processing happens locally on your machine or via the OpenClaw Gateway you provide.</p>

    <h2>2. Data Transmission</h2>
    <p>Any data extracted from web pages (such as text, images, or URLs) is sent <strong>exclusively</strong> to your self-hosted or user-configured OpenClaw Gateway URL. This communication occurs via secure API calls initiated by your explicit configuration.</p>

    <h2>3. Permissions Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> Used solely to save your local configurations, such as your Gateway URL and Authentication Token.</li>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> Used only when you interact with the extension to read the content of the currently active tab for processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Access</h2>
    <p>No data handled by this extension is shared with, sold to, or accessible by third parties. You have full control over the data flow.</p>
